        <h2>Guadalupe Ramirez</h2>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp;My name is Guadalupe Ramirez, I am twenty-two years old and I am from the Bron New York. My major is Multimedia and Programming. I am also a huge procastinator, so creating a website even though it was an exiting project, it was an exhausting one to do. As I mentioned in my Home Page; "I had a hard time thinking what to add to it", but at the end of the day i came threw with ideas to complete it. Some of my hobbies are videogames, drawing, and walking. </p>
                <p> &emsp; &emsp;I said I play videogames but I mostly play "Fortnite" with friends. I draw anything thst comes to my mind, but i haven't recently due to the amount of homework i have (for being a procrastinator ofcourse). The other hobby I haven't gotten a chance to do also, is walk. Due to COVID-19 many people including myself are unemployed and have to stay home. Instead of walking I have now been listening to my favorite artist. I enjoy listening to Hip-Hop/Rap. Some of my favorite artists are: Drake, The Weeknd, Eminem, Travis Scott, Lil Wayne, Lil Baby, Kevin Gates, and Kodak Black just to mention a few. </p>
        <p>&emsp; &emsp; Another fact about me is that i don't consider myself a "sneaker head", but I might be one. For me a sneaker head is a person who would tell you the story/origin of a sneaker after you show it to him. I don't think I'm a sneaker head, because I could only tell what type of sneaker it is (Brand, Name, and the Year that it came out). I discover my love for sneakers around maybe 4 years ago. I realized that there's a story behind every sneaker. Every one is unique, it might have the same silhouette but the color is what makes the difference. My interest grew more and more and I began to buy every sneaker I liked. Being an adult means having responsabilities and sometimes i had to decide between buying a nice pair of sneakers that might never come out to retail again or paying bills. Sometimes I would get lucky and buy an exclusive pair and sometimes I wouln't. But if you are interested to know what are some of my current sneaker rotation, I suggest you check out my gallery.       </p>
